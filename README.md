# Logistic-Regression 
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of logistic regression by exploring its mathematical foundations, implementation, and optimization techniques. It delves into the processes of forward and backward propagation, illustrating how the model learns from data by updating its parameters through gradient descent. Additionally, it covers key concepts such as cost functions, decision boundaries, and probability estimation, offering a step-by-step approach to building a logistic regression model from scratch. The project also discusses real-world applications, performance evaluation metrics, and potential challenges encountered when applying logistic regression in practice.
